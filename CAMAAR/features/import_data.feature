Feature: Import Data from SIGAA as Admin

  Scenario: Admin imports data
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on "gerenciamento" page
    And there is importable data
    When I click on "Importar dados" button
    Then the importable data should be imported

  Scenario: Admin tries to import data when none is available
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on "gerenciamento" page
    And there is no importable data
    When I click on "Importar dados" button
    Then I should see a message indicating that no data is available to import
    And no data should be imported

  Scenario: Import fails due to invalid data format
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on the "gerenciamento" page
    And there is importable data with an invalid format
    When I click on the "Importar dados" button
    Then I should see an error message indicating the data format is invalid
    And the import should be aborted

  Scenario: Import partially succeeds but some data is invalid
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on the "gerenciamento" page
    And there is importable data with some invalid data
    When I click on the "Importar dados" button
    Then the valid data should be imported
    And I should see a warning indicating that some data could not be imported
