Feature: Generate Report as Admin

  Scenario: Admin downloads response reports
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on "gerenciamento/resultados" page
    And there are created forms
    When I click on a form
    Then a CSV file containing the form responses should be downloaded

  Scenario: Admin tries to generate a report when no forms exist
    Given I am an admin
    When I am on the "gerenciamento/resultados" page
    And there are no created forms
    Then I should see a message indicating that no forms are available
    And no CSV file should be downloaded

  Scenario: Report generation fails due to an internal error
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on the "gerenciamento/resultados" page
    And there are created forms
    When I click on a form
    And an internal error occurs during report generation
    Then I should see an error message indicating that the report could not be generated
    And no CSV file should be downloaded

  Scenario: Admin clicks on a form that becomes unavailable
    Given I am an admin
    And I am on the "gerenciamento/resultados" page
    And there are created forms
    When I click on a form
    And the form is no longer available
    Then I should see a message indicating that the form cannot be accessed
